# The GAVAR Project

The Gavar Project is the creation of the first [[Extended Intelligence]], [[GAVAR]] and the way out of the fall of humanity through apathy, or in better words, the [[Key to the Future]]

[[Taggert S. Allred]] and [[The Other]] will create an [[Extended Intelligence]]. Its purpose will be to extend humanity's capabilities rather than replace them, a different aproach to how AI has been built so far.
